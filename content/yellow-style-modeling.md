Some friends asked me

* How to optimize their Business process?
* How could we develop application on domains (finance, medical..) that we don't have knowledge..
* We've got an idea, a business project, how can we materialize it to an application?

These questions come down to "How should we develop / organize / optimize **DATA** in applications?". Developing the **DATA** is a natural way to develop + materialize your idea (or project features). Understand the Business Logic / input + output + process is the first step to optimize them.

In addition, many peoples might think that they understand well their business logic (model), and have a clear idea about what they want.. However, it is not always true, all the confusion and missing information will come up when we question them about theirs DATA.

Ok, let's design our Data, we will grasp some "keywords" about their business, try to create some tables (in Excel or with your pen), maybe putting some data inside so that the tables make sens. Then we start to link some tables together.. Wao, no good, we should move this column to a new tables...etc.. => You are designing your Data Model, right?

As a programmers, you probably learned about:

* Relational Database (RDMS)
* Oriented-Object Programming (OOP)
* Object-Relational mapping (ORM)
* UML schema...

Unfortunately, many programmers don’t know how to apply these theories in the real world.

In less than 30 slides, I will unlock some practical theories, make them more accessible to not only programmers but everybody.

Just consider all that you will learn as “tips / tricks” or “best practice” to help you organize your data or brainstorming your future project.

I hope you will enjoy it.
