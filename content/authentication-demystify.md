In the process of revamping an old (classic) PHP application to a modern Single Page Application, I need to re-write the Authentication module.

This slide is my research on common questions / knowledege about Authentication:

* How the Authentication happened in the old PHP application?
* How it handled expired user, and keep active user stayed connected?
* What is the Oauth2, OpenId
* JWT
* What is 2-Factor authentication? How to implement it?

The most important part is my **Refresh-token strategy**. The "Refresh Token" automatic renew the tokens of active users so that they will stay connected.
I come up with a **stateless Refresh-token strategy** so that nothing need to be stored or keep track of on the server side (You can go straigt to the Slide 14)
