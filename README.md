# My personal website

This is a work in progress

None of the free blogging platforms fit my taste!

I've got no choice, but to create my own blog..

There is so many website generator today.
I don't wanna get trouble for a small personal blog.. so

I picked the (likely) most mature and popular one with a huge community backup..
my first attempt was [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) 

* the second most popular in the bunch
* I took interest in golang for sometimes

Zola is my second attempt, let see if a rust application meet the quality...
